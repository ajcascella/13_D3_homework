## Background

In this project I analyzed health risks facing particular demographics, as well as created charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand my findings.  I used information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.

## Step by Step

* Created a scatter plot between two of the data variables using D3.  Represent each state with circle elements. 

* Included state abbreviations in the circles.

* Created and situated axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

* Note: You'll need to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser.
